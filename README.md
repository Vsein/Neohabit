## Features

You can see the features overview with examples on the
[landing](https://vsein.github.io/neohabit). The list below repeats its contents:

- Intutive design for habits that happen more than once a day
- Habits happen X times in Y days, where X and Y are positive integers
- Ability to set targets, and change them on the go
- Tracking numeric values and setting numeric targets

### Github/Anki-style heatmaps, with all the above features

## Ultimate vision

My ultimate vision for Neohabit is to have a public, community-driven archive of
habits that may be imported into your database/account, with all the needed
progressions. Somewhat similar to the Anki's shared decks, except for habits.
I've implemented the core feature - the habit-tracking part, but the rest of it
still needs some time to come together.

For example:
- There's the tasklist section that I want to integrate with habits, so you can
  see which habits are due today (currently the tasks are dangling in their own
  section, and weren't my development focus)
- The skilltrees are implemented, but I'm aware of a couple of bugs there, and
  right now there's no way to start habits directly based on the skills listed
  in the skilltree. I may even take skilltrees as the base for importing new
  habits, I guess it'll be more clear in the future.
- "The blocks" page is dangling as a section in the side menu, but I think it'll
  just be a link to a website with all the archived skilltrees/habits.
- Contribution guides and community support/groups

To anyone who's kind enough to donate, thank you! Neohabit's development has
cost me more than I'm comfortable admitting, if not financially then just in time
alone. Spreading the word and mentioning this project to your friends is also
welcome and much appreciated.
